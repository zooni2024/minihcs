# Pinterest Backlink & Authority Guide 🚀

## 🛠️ How to Create a High-Authority Pin (Step-by-Step)
1. **Vertical Image is Key:** Always use a 2:3 ratio (e.g., 1000 x 1500px). Use the HD images from your `public` folder.
2. **The "Destination Link":** This is your backlink. Ensure it points to the specific article, not just the homepage.
3. **Alt Text:** Fill the "Alt Text" field with a descriptive sentence (e.g., "Fluffy Mini Highland Cow grazing in a green pasture"). This helps Pinterest SEO.

## 📂 Pinterest Boards Strategy

2. **Animal Kingdom Guides** (Pin your 7-types and A-Z content here)
3. **Small Farm Tools** (Pin your Calculator here)

**Pro Tip:** Always pin other people's high-quality content to your boards too. This makes your account look like a "Resource Hub" rather than just a promotional one.
